## üåü Exciting Spring Boot Annotations for Building Powerful Applications! üåü

Hey GitHub fam! üëã Today, I want to share with you some essential Spring Boot annotations that can supercharge your development process. These annotations make it easier to build robust and efficient applications. Let's dive in!


## üöÄ Spring Boot Main Annotations üöÄ

1Ô∏è‚É£ @SpringBootApplication: This is the starting point of any Spring Boot application. It combines three annotations - @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan. It sets up the application, enables auto-configuration, and scans for components.

2Ô∏è‚É£ @ComponentScan: This annotation tells Spring where to look for components, such as controllers, services, and repositories. It helps Spring find and register these components automatically.

3Ô∏è‚É£ @EnableAutoConfiguration: This annotation enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration feature, which automatically configures the application based on the dependencies present in the classpath. It saves you from writing boilerplate configuration code.

4Ô∏è‚É£ @Configuration: This annotation identifies a class as a configuration class. It declares and wires beans that can be used by the application. It's a key building block for creating custom configurations.



## üí° Stereotype Annotations üí°

1Ô∏è‚É£ @Component: This annotation marks a class as a Spring-managed component. It's a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.4

2Ô∏è‚É£ @Service: This annotation represents a service layer component. It's used to define business logic and perform service-oriented tasks.

3Ô∏è‚É£ @RestController / @Controller: These annotations are used to define controller classes that handle incoming HTTP requests. @RestController is a combination of @Controller and @ResponseBody, making it ideal for building RESTful APIs.

4Ô∏è‚É£ @Repository: This annotation is used to identify a class as a data access object (DAO) or repository. It enables Spring to perform database operations easily.


## üå± Spring Core Annotations (Continued) üå±

1Ô∏è‚É£ @Bean: This annotation is used inside a configuration class to define a bean. A bean represents an object that Spring manages and injects into other parts of the application.

2Ô∏è‚É£ @Autowired: With this annotation, you can automatically inject dependencies into your beans. It helps to wire different parts of your application together effortlessly.

3Ô∏è‚É£ @Qualifier: When multiple beans of the same type exist, @Qualifier helps in selecting the correct bean to be injected.
4Ô∏è‚É£ @Lazy: This annotation tells Spring to create a bean only when it's needed, not during the application startup. It can save resources if the bean is not always used.

5Ô∏è‚É£ @Value: It is used to inject values from properties files or environment variables into Spring beans.

6Ô∏è‚É£ @PropertySource: This annotation allows you to specify the properties file from which the @Value annotation will read the values.

7Ô∏è‚É£ @ConfigurationProperties: It binds external configuration properties to fields of a Java bean.

8Ô∏è‚É£ @Profile: With this annotation, you can define beans that will be activated based on specific profiles. It helps in managing different configurations for different environments.

9Ô∏è‚É£ @Scope: This annotation allows you to specify the scope of a Spring bean (singleton, prototype, etc.). It defines how many instances of a bean should exist.


## üåê REST API Annotations üåê

These annotations are crucial for building RESTful APIs in Spring Boot.
1Ô∏è‚É£ @RestController: As we mentioned earlier, this annotation combines @Controller and @ResponseBody. It's used to create RESTful web services that directly return data in the response body.

2Ô∏è‚É£ @RequestMapping: This annotation maps HTTP requests to specific controller methods based on the URL pattern.

3Ô∏è‚É£ @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping: These annotations specify the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that a controller method can handle.

4Ô∏è‚É£ @RequestBody: It's used to extract the request body and convert it into a Java object for processing.

5Ô∏è‚É£ @PathVariable: This annotation binds the URL template variables to the method parameters.

6Ô∏è‚É£ @RequestParam: It binds query parameters from the URL to the method parameters.

7Ô∏è‚É£ @ControllerAdvice & @ExceptionHandler: These annotations are used for global exception handling in Spring MVC applications. They help to handle exceptions across all controllers.

## üìö Spring Data JPA Annotations üìö

These annotations simplify working with relational databases using JPA (Java Persistence API).
1Ô∏è‚É£ @Entity: This annotation marks a class as an entity, representing a table in the database.

2Ô∏è‚É£ @Table: It is used to specify the table name associated with the entity.

3Ô∏è‚É£ @Column: This annotation maps a class field to a database column.

4Ô∏è‚É£ @Transactional: This annotation defines a transactional method or class. It ensures that the method is executed within a transaction.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Entity class relationships: @OneToOne, @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany: These annotations define relationships between entities, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many.

## üìöSpring Security Annotationsüìö

1Ô∏è‚É£@EnableWebSecurity: This annotation enables the Spring Security configuration for securing web applications.

2Ô∏è‚É£@Secured: It is used to apply method-level security to controllers or service methods.

3Ô∏è‚É£@PreAuthorize / @PostAuthorize: These annotations define pre- or post-authorization expressions to restrict access to methods based on specific conditions.

4Ô∏è‚É£@AuthenticationPrincipal: It allows you to access the currently authenticated user principal within a controller or service.

## üåüSpring Caching Annotationsüåü

1Ô∏è‚É£@EnableCaching: This annotation enables Spring's caching infrastructure for caching method results.

2Ô∏è‚É£@Cacheable: It indicates that the result of a method should be cached. Subsequent calls with the same parameters will be retrieved from the cache instead of executing the method.

3Ô∏è‚É£@CacheEvict: This annotation is used to remove specific entries or clear the entire cache.

4Ô∏è‚É£@CachePut: It updates the cache with the result of a method, regardless of whether the cache already contains a value for the given key.

## üåüSpring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) Annotationüåü

1Ô∏è‚É£@Aspect: This annotation defines a class as an aspect, which encapsulates cross-cutting concerns.

2Ô∏è‚É£@Pointcut: It specifies a set of join points (methods) where an advice (aspect) should be applied.

3Ô∏è‚É£@Before, @After, @AfterReturning, @AfterThrowing: These annotations specify different types of advice that should be executed before, after, or around a method invocation.

4Ô∏è‚É£@Around: It allows you to wrap the advised method with custom code, controlling the entire method invocation.

## üå±Spring Validation Annotationsüå±

1Ô∏è‚É£@Valid: This annotation is used to validate the annotated object or method parameter.

2Ô∏è‚É£@NotNull, @NotEmpty, @NotBlank: These annotations are used to specify constraints on fields or method parameters, such as not allowing null, empty, or whitespace values.

3Ô∏è‚É£@Min, @Max, @Size: They define constraints on numeric values or the size of collections or strings.

4Ô∏è‚É£@Pattern: It validates the annotated element against a regular expression pattern.

## Spring Task Scheduling Annotations:
1Ô∏è‚É£ @EnableScheduling: This annotation enables Spring's task scheduling capabilities.

2Ô∏è‚É£@Scheduled: It is used to define a method as a scheduled task. You can specify the fixed rate, initial delay, or cron expression for executing the task.
## Spring Messaging Annotations:
1Ô∏è‚É£ @EnableWebSocket: This annotation enables WebSocket support in Spring applications.

2Ô∏è‚É£ @MessageMapping: It maps a specific WebSocket message to a method in a controller.

3Ô∏è‚É£ @SubscribeMapping: This annotation maps a WebSocket subscription message to a method in a controller.

## Spring Testing Annotations:
1Ô∏è‚É£ @RunWith: This annotation is used to specify the test runner class for running unit tests.

2Ô∏è‚É£ @SpringBootTest: It can be used to load and configure the complete Spring Boot application context for integration testing.

3Ô∏è‚É£ @MockBean: This annotation creates a mock implementation of a bean for testing purposes.

## Spring Integration Annotations:
1Ô∏è‚É£ @IntegrationComponentScan: This annotation enables component scanning for Spring Integration components.

2Ô∏è‚É£ @ServiceActivator: It is used to define a method as a service activator within a Spring Integration flow.
